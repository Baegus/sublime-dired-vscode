# Sublime Dired for VS Code (WIP)

A Visual Studio Code extension to edit directories and files as text buffers. Inspired by the [dired extension for Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/dired). Originally inspired by dired mode in Emacs.

There are some other implementations of Dired for VS Code available, but I really liked the Sublime Text extension which allows renaming files and directories from within the text buffer, allowing features such as multi-cursor editing, search & replace, etc. This is an attempt to recreate that extension.
